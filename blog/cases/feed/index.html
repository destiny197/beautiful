<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Client&#8217;s story</h2>



<p>The brand started as a passion project in the dropshipping space — built around a simple idea: everyday comfort shouldn’t come with compromise. Focused on solving real problems for real people, the store launched with a single goal: to bring high-quality, leak-proof underwear to women seeking discreet, stylish, and reliable protection. What began as a test product quickly found its audience, proving that even in dropshipping, you can build trust with the right offer, the right message, and a product that helps.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges we faced</h2>



<p>When the client partnered with us, they were starting entirely from scratch — no data, no pixel history, no previous campaigns. Our mission: build a full-funnel, scalable Google Ads strategy in a competitive dropshipping niche, with a low average order value (~$41) and zero brand recognition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Growth Method</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 1: Market &amp; competitor analysis</h3>



<p>We defined:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The top-performing brands in the leakproof underwear niche</li>



<li>Their pricing strategies, ad copy, and bundling logic</li>



<li>Related international markets for future expansion</li>
</ul>



<p>This helped us spot the gaps and opportunities early on.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Step 2: Multi-Campaign Launch Strategy</h3>



<p>We built a diversified campaign structure designed to feed Google’s algorithm high-quality signals fast:</p>



<p><strong>Search Campaigns</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Competitor Brand Search: Targeted phrase-match competitor brand names to capture warm search traffic.</li>



<li>High-Intent Keywords: Focused on terms like “leakproof underwear for women,” “period underwear,” and “incontinence panties”.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Shopping &amp; Performance Max</strong><br>Launched with four audience signals:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>High-performing keywords</li>



<li>Competitor interest segments</li>



<li>Demographics</li>



<li>Feed-only (to let Google learn directly from product data)</li>
</ul>

<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Cost per Conversion:</strong> ~$32</li>



<li><strong>Average Order Value:</strong> ~$41</li>



<li><strong>Break-Even ROAS:</strong> Too tight for consistent profit</li>
</ul>



<p>The data was clear: one-product orders couldn’t sustain scale.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Break-even point calculations</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Solving the AOV issue</h2>



<p>Inspired by successful competitors, we introduced new product packs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Initial Test:</strong> 3-pack, 5-pack, 8-pack</li>



<li><strong>Result:</strong> Average order value jumped from <strong>$41 </strong>to<strong> $73.33</strong></li>



<li><strong>Key Insight:</strong> 5-pack was the best seller (most perceived value)</li>
</ul>



<p>We doubled down:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Highlighted the <strong>10-pack</strong> as the “smart choice” to drive even higher AOV</li>



<li>Rebuilt product pages around bundle logic and value perception</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Scaling the Winners</h2>



<p>With stronger unit economics, we scaled:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>PMax and Shopping campaigns aggressively</li>



<li>Integrated winning search terms into product titles in GMC</li>



<li>Added <strong>advertorial pre-landers</strong> to warm up cold traffic, resulting in improved conversion rates</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Results</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sales:</strong> 1,591 orders</li>



<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $115,508.70</li>



<li><strong>ROAS:</strong> 219%</li>



<li><strong>AOV:</strong> $70.54</li>



<li><strong>CAC:</strong> Now profitable at scale</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Client’s Story</h2>



<p>Coverslee specialises in intimate accessories that combine comfort with discretion. <strong>Despite offering quality products, their online sales lagged due to underperforming Google Shopping listings.</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><br>Initial Request</h3>



<p>We aim to optimise Google Ads&#8217; performance, increase transactions, and drive profitable growth.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges we faced</h2>



<p><strong>Main Issue:</strong> Coverslee’s products were lost in the vast online marketplace. They faced several hurdles:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Essential product information, such as keywords and categories, was missing or incomplete.</li>



<li>They weren’t fully utilising the features of Google Merchant Centre, affecting their visibility.</li>
</ul>



<p>Product titles and descriptions lacked the appeal needed to draw clicks and conversions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="614" src="https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MonosnapCampaigns-NaturalVibes28new29-GoogleAds2025-04-1014-22-36-1024x614.png" alt="" class="wp-image-246" srcset="https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MonosnapCampaigns-NaturalVibes28new29-GoogleAds2025-04-1014-22-36-1024x614.png 1024w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MonosnapCampaigns-NaturalVibes28new29-GoogleAds2025-04-1014-22-36-300x180.png 300w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MonosnapCampaigns-NaturalVibes28new29-GoogleAds2025-04-1014-22-36-768x460.png 768w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MonosnapCampaigns-NaturalVibes28new29-GoogleAds2025-04-1014-22-36-1536x920.png 1536w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MonosnapCampaigns-NaturalVibes28new29-GoogleAds2025-04-1014-22-36.png 1886w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Growth Method</h2>



<p>To elevate Coverslee&#8217;s presence on Google Shopping, we employed a multi-faceted approach:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Enhanced Product Ratings and Seller Ratings:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Before:</strong> No ratings were displayed, leaving potential customers uncertain.</li>



<li><strong>After:</strong> We activated ratings to show off positive customer feedback, which built trust and credibility.<br></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Promotional Campaigns Setup:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Before:</strong> Promotions were not being used effectively to attract attention.</li>



<li><strong>After:</strong> We introduced eye-catching promotions that appeared directly in the shopping ads, enhancing click-through rates.<br></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Revamped Titles and Descriptions:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Before:</strong> Titles and descriptions were bland and not optimised for search queries.</li>



<li><strong>After:</strong> We injected relevant keywords into titles and crafted compelling descriptions highlighting the products&#8217; unique benefits. For example, we changed “Silicone Nipple Covers” to “Mini Silicone Nipple Covers | Vanilla Circle Shape, Size AA–A | Adhesive-Free, Invisible Pasties | Coverslee,” emphasising the unique selling points and target audience.<br></li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Refined Product Categorisation:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Before:</strong> Products were often misclassified or too broadly categorised.</li>



<li><strong>After:</strong> We meticulously categorised products to ensure they appeared under specific, relevant search queries, making them easier to find by the target audience.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Client’s Story</h2>



<p>Krustic is a premium brand offering high-quality Dutch Ovens for the U.S. market. <strong>The brand had previously launched multiple Meta Ads campaigns but struggled with low ROAS and minimal profitability.</strong></p>



<p><strong>See the real impact in the video case study</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="I Scaled A Facebook Ads Campaign by 113X Using This Strategy | Facebook Ads and Shopify Case Study" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CQRnTQKFL3M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Initial Request</h3>



<p>Our team was tasked with reimagining Krustic’s paid traffic strategy to achieve profitability and maintain a consistent target ROAS.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Challenges we faced</h2>



<p>As a newcomer in a competitive niche, <strong>Krustic lacked the historical performance data essential for optimizing Meta Ads.</strong> Previous campaigns resulted in a low starting ROAS of just 0.22, highlighting inefficiencies in audience targeting. The brand required a strategic overhaul to unlock its potential and build a loyal customer base.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="508" src="https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/krustic-before-1024x508.png" alt="" class="wp-image-211" srcset="https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/krustic-before-1024x508.png 1024w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/krustic-before-300x149.png 300w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/krustic-before-768x381.png 768w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/krustic-before-1536x761.png 1536w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/krustic-before.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Growth Method</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Strategic analysis:</h3>



<p>We examined Krustic’s advertising history, pinpointing misaligned targeting strategies and underperforming creatives. We then recognized that algorithms need to learn from relevant data and launched interest-based campaigns tailored to audiences most likely to appreciate Krustic’s durable and functional Dutch Ovens.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Building a retargeting foundation:</h3>



<p>A traffic campaign was launched alongside interest-based campaigns to drive more users to the website while building an audience base for future retargeting. This campaign ran on a minimal budget and played a key role in generating warm leads for future conversions.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Leveraging Advantage+ Shopping campaigns for optimization:</h3>



<p>To capitalize on the foundation laid, we introduced Meta’s Advantage+Shopping campaigns. This advanced tool harnesses AI to automatically optimize ad delivery, identifying top-performing audience segments, placements, and creative combinations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Creative testing:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In our campaigns, we used UGC videos where users shared their experiences with Krustic, showcasing authentic feedback. At the same time, we recognized the potential of static ads and strongly emphasized the 20% discount on the website. These static ads also highlighted Krustic’s Dutch Ovens&#8217; key benefits, appealing to emotional and practical buying motivations.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Client’s Story</h2>



<p>This electronics brand, founded in Paris in 2015, is at the forefront of merging medicine, sports, and technology to democratize advanced health solutions. Their mission is to make cutting-edge medical technologies more accessible to a wider audience, promoting well-being and enhancing everyday lives through innovation. Despite their strong product lineup and clear mission, they needed a more refined strategy to increase transaction volumes and maintain profitability across competitive markets. Their goal was to <strong>ensure sustained growth while keeping the Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) above 2.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Starting Point</h2>



<p>When we began working with this brand, the primary challenge was to drive higher transaction volumes on their website while maintaining an efficient advertising budget. They had been running campaigns but weren’t fully capitalizing on their potential for scaling. Our task was to build a strategy that not only increased their sales but also kept their ROAS at a healthy level, ensuring every advertising dollar spent returned maximum value.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="544" src="https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/website-case-study-electronics-before-1024x544.png" alt="" class="wp-image-198" srcset="https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/website-case-study-electronics-before-1024x544.png 1024w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/website-case-study-electronics-before-300x160.png 300w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/website-case-study-electronics-before-768x408.png 768w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/website-case-study-electronics-before.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Growth Method</h2>



<p>To meet the project’s ambitious goals, we approached the challenge from multiple angles, starting with a comprehensive audit and moving into strategic testing and optimization.</p>



<p><strong>Technical Audit:</strong> We began with a thorough technical audit, assessing their Facebook Pixel, Conversions API, Google Tag, and event tracking to ensure everything was set up correctly for accurate performance measurement.</p>



<p><strong>Campaign Audit:</strong> We analyzed their previous campaigns to understand what had worked and what hadn’t, pulling insights that would inform our new strategy.</p>



<p><strong>Full-Funnel Strategy:</strong> A complete marketing strategy was developed to engage the audience at every stage of the funnel—from awareness to conversion. This involved using a mix of contextual advertising for top-of-funnel awareness and Meta Ads for more targeted retargeting efforts.</p>



<p><strong>User Experience Enhancements:</strong> We enhanced the user experience on the website by developing unique banners, pop-ups, and integrating a chatbot to provide seamless communication with customers 24/7.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Campaign Types Launched</h2>



<p>To maximize reach and drive conversions, we implemented various campaign types that aligned with the brand’s business model:</p>



<p><strong>Brand Search Campaigns:</strong> To boost brand awareness and improve visibility across search engines.</p>



<p><strong>Performance Max Campaigns:</strong> These campaigns helped reach a broader audience, maximizing the chances of finding new customers across multiple channels.</p>



<p><strong>Mobile App-Specific Ads:</strong> Targeted ads were developed to drive mobile app engagement, reaching specific audiences more effectively and increasing app downloads.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li></li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Optimization and Continuous Improvement</h2>



<p>Throughout the project, we focused on constant optimization:</p>



<p><strong>Campaign Settings and Targeting:</strong> We tested different campaign settings, continuously refining them to identify the most effective combinations that drove results.</p>



<p><strong>Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO):</strong> We worked with the client to improve the website’s conversion flow, ensuring that incoming traffic was converting at a higher rate.</p>



<p><strong>Geographical Expansion:</strong> Our efforts contributed to the successful expansion into new markets, including Germany and Spain, where the brand achieved a leading position.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Success in Numbers</h2>



<p>Our efforts led to significant results for the client:</p>



<p><strong>Transaction Growth:</strong> The number of transactions increased dramatically, with revenue rising from €10,384.91 to €58,511.13.</p>



<p><strong>Improved Brand Awareness:</strong> Our campaigns significantly boosted brand recognition and loyalty among the target audience, building trust and long-term customer relationships.</p>



<p><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> We reduced the Cost per Click by 87%, making the advertising budget more efficient and driving better results for less spend.</p>



<p><strong>Profitability:</strong> The overall Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) and conversion rate improved, leading to greater profitability for the business.</p>

<p>This clothing dropshipping brand combines a passion for fashion with impeccable style, offering a curated selection of top-tier jackets and clothing. Their products make bold statements while ensuring comfort and functionality, attracting fashion-forward customers who seek both style and practicality. Despite having a strong product range and a loyal customer base, they were struggling to achieve consistent growth in highly competitive markets. Their goal was to scale sales and optimize their advertising efforts across key regions, including the USA, Germany, UK, and Italy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Starting Point</h2>



<p>When we started working with the client in April 2024, their Meta Ads performance was falling short of expectations. Although they had been running campaigns, the results weren’t aligned with their revenue goals. They needed a more refined strategy that not only increased traffic but also <strong>drove high-quality conversions</strong>, making the most of their ad spend. Our task was to build a scalable Meta Ads strategy that would help them <strong>hit their target of €50,000 in monthly sales.</strong></p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="477" src="https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/website-case-study-clothing-drop-before-1024x477.png" alt="" class="wp-image-194" srcset="https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/website-case-study-clothing-drop-before-1024x477.png 1024w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/website-case-study-clothing-drop-before-300x140.png 300w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/website-case-study-clothing-drop-before-768x358.png 768w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/website-case-study-clothing-drop-before.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Growth Method</h2>



<p>To meet the sales targets, we took a structured, multi-step approach focusing on both technical optimization and creative strategy.</p>



<p><strong>Meta Ads Audit:</strong> We started with a thorough audit of their Meta Ads account, reviewing historical data and technical setup. This helped us identify gaps and opportunities for improving their advertising efforts.</p>



<p><strong>Competitor Analysis:</strong> We analyzed competitor campaigns to understand how similar brands were positioning themselves and where there were opportunities to outperform them.</p>



<p><strong>Full-Funnel Strategy:</strong> We developed a comprehensive Meta Ads strategy that spanned all stages of the customer journey, from awareness (TOFU) to consideration (MOFU) and conversion (BOFU). This ensured that we were capturing the right audience at every point in the funnel.</p>



<p><strong>Catalog and Instagram Shop Optimization:</strong> The Meta catalog and Instagram Shop were optimized to make products more discoverable and user-friendly for shoppers on both platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Creative Formats:</strong> We launched a variety of creative ad types, including user-generated content (UGC) videos, Carousel ads, Static images, Catalog ads, and Collection ads. This mix of creative formats allowed us to engage customers across multiple touchpoints and experiment with what worked best for the target audience.</p>



<p><strong>Targeting and Audience Segmentation:</strong> We tested a variety of targeting methods, refining our approach as data came in. This allowed us to identify top-performing audience segments and allocate budget accordingly to maximize ROI.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Optimization Efforts</h2>



<p>Optimization was an ongoing process, and our focus shifted toward improving performance and increasing profitability:</p>



<p><strong>Account Structure and Traffic Quality:</strong> We structured the Meta Ads account to drive high-quality traffic from the start, which helped the Pixel learn quickly and convert more effectively. This rapid learning phase enabled us to reach high conversion volumes early on.</p>



<p><strong>Creative Hypothesis Testing:</strong> We continuously tested new creative formats and messaging hypotheses, keeping the content fresh and aligned with changing audience preferences.</p>



<p><strong>Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO):</strong> Beyond ads, we worked with the client to identify opportunities for improving the website’s conversion rate. By enhancing the user experience on-site, we could turn more traffic into transactions, further boosting revenue.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Success in Numbers</h2>



<p>Our Meta Ads strategy drove remarkable results in just a few months:</p>



<p><strong>Transaction Growth:</strong> We increased transactions from 481 to 2,102, representing a substantial boost in both engagement and sales.</p>



<p><strong>Revenue Growth:</strong> Revenue jumped from $34,750.11 to $174,609.20, delivering a ROAS of 3.96, far exceeding initial expectations.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Client’s Story</h2>



<p>This furniture and home decor brand offers a curated collection of globally inspired, ethically sourced pieces designed to bring a sense of adventure and craftsmanship into every home. Their eclectic range appeals to customers seeking unique decor that tells a story, adding character and culture to their spaces. Although they had a strong product lineup, they were looking to scale their online sales and enhance their visibility in the highly competitive Australian market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Starting Point</h2>



<p>When we started working with this brand in February 2024, their main objective was to <strong>generate $10,000 in monthly sales while maintaining a Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) of 5 or higher.</strong> They had been running ads but weren’t seeing the expected results in terms of profitability and growth. To meet their ambitious targets, they needed a strategy that would fine-tune their audience targeting, improve ad spend efficiency, and significantly boost their return on investment through Facebook Ads.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Growth Method</h2>



<p>Our strategy involved a combination of technical optimization, creative design, and data-driven audience targeting. Here’s how we approached the project:</p>



<p><strong>Facebook Ads Audit:</strong> We performed a comprehensive audit of their Facebook Ads setup, analyzing old data and ensuring the proper integration of the Facebook Conversion API for accurate tracking and performance measurement.</p>



<p><strong>Competitor and Campaign Review:</strong> By analyzing their previous campaigns and studying competitor strategies, we identified key areas for improvement. This analysis helped us refine our approach to Facebook and Instagram advertising, allowing us to better capture their target market.</p>



<p><strong>Funnel Strategy:</strong> We implemented a full-funnel strategy that addressed each stage of the customer journey — from awareness to conversion (TOFU, MOFU, BOFU). This involved creating tailored campaigns to drive engagement, retargeting past visitors, and converting leads into paying customers.</p>



<p><strong>Platform Optimization:</strong> We optimized the Fcebook Ads Manager, and the Instagram Shop, ensuring products were well-presented and easily discoverable to a wider audience. This boosted product visibility, especially for those browsing through Instagram’s visual platform.</p>



<p><strong>Creative Testing:</strong> We launched a variety of ad formats, including Instagram video ads, UGC (user-generated content) videos, carousels, and product catalogs. This allowed us to engage users at different touchpoints and refine our creative approach based on audience response.</p>



<p><strong>Audience Targeting:</strong> Through rigorous testing of different targeting methods, we identified top-performing audience groups for the brand’s e-commerce campaigns. This included adjusting demographics, interests, and behaviors to ensure the ads reached the most relevant customers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Optimization Efforts</h2>



<p>Throughout the campaign, our focus was on continuous improvement:</p>



<p><strong>Ad Structure:</strong> We built a robust account structure for their Facebook Ads, designed to drive high-quality traffic to the website. This ensured the campaigns could scale effectively and increase conversion rates.</p>



<p><strong>Creative Evolution:</strong> Working closely with a Facebook Ads media buyer and Instagram ads specialist, we consistently developed new creative ideas to keep the content fresh and relevant for the audience.</p>



<p><strong>Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO):</strong> Beyond ad performance, we also collaborated with the client to identify opportunities for optimizing the website’s conversion rate, ensuring the traffic from the ads translated into more sales.</p>



<p>These efforts resulted in <strong>improved conversions and a higher ROAS</strong>, making the campaigns more profitable and positioning the account for further growth on both Facebook and Instagram.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Success in Numbers</h2>



<p>By leveraging a well-structured Facebook and Instagram ads strategy, we achieved outstanding results:</p>



<p><strong>Transactions:</strong> The campaigns generated 272 transactions.</p>



<p><strong>Revenue Growth:</strong> We increased revenue to $111,264.37 with a ROAS of 5.16, surpassing the original goal of $10,000 in monthly sales.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Starting Point</h2>



<p>When we started working with the business in June 2024, the primary goal was to <strong>generate €5,000 in monthly sales through highly targeted Google Ads campaigns.</strong> While they had a strong product line and a clear brand mission, their existing ad campaigns weren’t driving the needed engagement or revenue. </p>



<p>They required a more precise, data-driven strategy to increase customer acquisition and improve their Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) across multiple markets, including the Netherlands, Belgium, the UK, Ireland, and Spain.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="289" src="https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-27-1024x289.png" alt="" class="wp-image-148" srcset="https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-27-1024x289.png 1024w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-27-300x85.png 300w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-27-768x217.png 768w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/image-27.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Growth Method</h2>



<p>Our approach combined a deep analysis of past campaign data, competitor strategies, and performance optimization. </p>



<p>Here’s how we laid the groundwork for success:</p>



<p><strong>Google Ads Audit:</strong> We began by auditing their historical data and technical setup to understand where their previous campaigns were underperforming.</p>



<p><strong>Competitor Analysis:</strong> To get an edge, we studied competitor strategies and incorporated key insights into our new approach.</p>



<p><strong>Funnel Strategy:</strong> We designed a full-funnel Google Ads strategy, covering TOFU (Top of Funnel), MOFU (Middle of Funnel), and BOFU (Bottom of Funnel) to ensure we captured attention at every stage of the customer journey.</p>



<p><strong>Market Optimization:</strong> The business operates in multiple countries, so we optimized the Google Merchant Center to cater to each market’s unique needs.</p>



<p><strong>Campaign Launch:</strong> We launched various campaign types, including Performance Max, Search, and Shopping campaigns, to target the right audiences and maximize visibility.</p>



<p><strong>Keywords &amp; Product Analysis:</strong> We conducted an in-depth analysis of search terms and identified top-performing and low-performing products, adjusting our scaling strategies accordingly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Optimization Efforts</h2>



<p>Once the campaigns were live, our focus shifted toward constant optimization:</p>



<p><strong>Multilingual Campaigns:</strong> We ran campaigns in different languages, ensuring our messaging resonated with diverse audiences in each target market.</p>



<p><strong>Budget Adjustments:</strong> By identifying the top-performing countries by revenue and ROAS, we could allocate budgets more effectively, maximizing profitability.</p>



<p><strong>Advanced Keyword Research:</strong> We used advanced tools to continually search for new, high-performing keywords to capture more qualified traffic.</p>



<p><strong>Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO):</strong> Besides ad optimization, we worked closely with the client to identify website improvements that could enhance conversion rates.</p>



<p>This constant iteration and fine-tuning led to an <strong>impressive increase in revenue and ROAS</strong>, setting the stage for vertical (deeper market penetration) and horizontal (expansion into new products and regions) scaling.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Success in Numbers</h2>



<p>The results of our optimized Google Ads strategy far exceeded the initial targets:</p>



<p><strong>Transaction Growth:</strong> We increased the number of transactions from 67 to 607, which significantly boosted engagement and sales.</p>



<p><strong>Revenue Increase:</strong> Revenue soared from $4,380.73 to $39,570.52, a remarkable improvement driven by more efficient targeting and optimization.</p>



<p><strong>ROAS:</strong> Achieved an impressive 20.52 ROAS, ensuring that each dollar spent on advertising generated substantial returns for the client.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Client&#8217;s Story</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">This business has been a leader in high-quality vintage fashion for three generations. Their love for vintage clothing drives every step, from carefully sourcing unique pieces to ensuring each item meets their high standards. Committed to making fashion more accessible, they prioritize sustainability and building strong community connections through their business practices.</p>



<p>Despite their expertise in vintage fashion, the business was<strong> struggling to scale its revenue and increase sales</strong>. Their goal was to double their transactions and revenue by selling more boxes and bales of vintage clothing, <strong>targeting a 300%+ Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)</strong>. They also aimed to expand their market reach, both in the <strong>B2B and B2C segments</strong>, and enhance their financial performance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Starting Point</h2>

<p>To meet these goals, we developed a growth strategy that addressed both technical and creative needs:</p>



<p><strong>Technical Audit:</strong> We conducted a full audit of their Facebook Pixel and Conversions API to assess the current setup.</p>



<p><strong>Campaign Review:</strong> We audited previous Meta Ads campaigns to gain insights into what worked and what didn’t.</p>



<p><strong>Marketing Strategy:</strong> Developed a tailored marketing strategy covering all stages of the funnel for both B2B and B2C audiences.</p>

<p><strong>Segmented Retargeting:</strong> Implemented retargeting strategies specific to B2B and B2C segments.</p>



<p><strong>Interest-Based Targeting:</strong> Ran acquisition campaigns focusing on audience interests to identify and separate B2B from B2C opportunities.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Client&#8217;s Story</h2>



<p>Our client is a sustainable business on a mission to create eco-friendly products, specifically organic socks. Their products are made from organic cotton and recycled plastic, free from toxic chemicals and dyes, ensuring a safer option for both people and the planet. By integrating eco-conscious manufacturing from start to finish, they’re offering a product and a lifestyle choice for health-conscious and eco-friendly consumers across Europe.</p>



<p>Despite their solid values and innovative products, the business faced challenges in scaling sales and improving its advertising efficiency. They aimed to generate €250,000 in sales with an €80,000 ad spend and improve their Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) from 1.7 to 2.0.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Starting Point</h2>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="361" src="https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-13-1024x361.png" alt="" class="wp-image-131" srcset="https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-13-1024x361.png 1024w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-13-300x106.png 300w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-13-768x270.png 768w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-13-1536x541.png 1536w, https://um.marketing/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/image-13.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Growth Method</h2>



<p>Our first task was to fix the technical issues. We conducted a comprehensive review of the tracking systems, including Meta Pixel and Conversions API, ensuring all data could be accurately captured. After resolving these foundational issues, we developed a new marketing strategy that focused on their home market in Germany and new market entries, specifically France.</p>



<p><strong>Google Ads Optimization:</strong> We started refining the Google Merchant Center and optimizing their shopping feeds. We launched targeted shopping and Performance Max (PM) campaigns and tested multiple campaign formats for high- and low-performing products.</p>



<p><strong>Meta Ads Strategy:</strong> On Meta, we experimented with different audience segments and creatives. Key audience groups — shopping interests, broad interests, and custom lookalike lists — were tested for effectiveness. After initial underperformance, our tests revealed that the Advantage+ Shopping format became one of the most profitable formats once the creatives and targeting were refined.</p>



<p><strong>Market Expansion:</strong> Entering the French market required a unique approach. We experimented with different ad formats and optimized Google Merchant feeds for French audiences, which led to impressive growth and rapid adoption in the region.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Success in Numbers</h2>



<p>The results of these efforts speak for themselves. Over a few months, we significantly increased transactions and revenue:</p>



<p><strong>Transactions:</strong> Increased from 155 to 955, marking a 516% growth.</p>



<p><strong>Revenue:</strong> Grew from €5,748.21 to €37,294.85 — a remarkable increase that positioned the brand for further expansion and success.</p>



<p>We also achieved Black Friday-level transaction volumes, setting a new standard for the client’s ongoing campaigns.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">In the Client’s Own Words</h2>



<p><em>&#8220;The transformation has been incredible. We were struggling to fix tracking issues and reach our target markets effectively. Still, this new strategy resolved our technical issues and helped us achieve numbers we had only seen during peak sales events. Their deep understanding of Google and Meta Ads helped us optimize our spend and scale sustainably.&#8221;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Our Strategy Delivered Results</h2>



<p><strong>Foundational Fixes:</strong> By resolving the tracking issues, we unlocked the potential to optimize the campaigns accurately and make data-driven decisions.</p>



<p><strong>Comprehensive Testing:</strong> We tested various ad formats, creatives, and audience segments across Meta and Google platforms to ensure every angle was covered.</p>



<p><strong>Market Expansion:</strong> Our targeted strategy for the French market, combined with constant testing and feed optimization, gave the client an advantage in a new geography.</p>



<p><strong>Creative Refinement:</strong> Tailoring content to resonate with different audience segments amplified campaign success and boosted conversion rates.</p>



<p><strong>Performance Max Campaigns:</strong> Leveraging PM campaigns allowed us to automate and optimize ad delivery, driving higher results with lower costs.</p>



<p>This strategic approach helped the client achieve sustainable growth while staying true to their core values of environmental sustainability.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Client&#8217;s Story</h2>



<p>Our client is a self-care company founded by a unique partnership between a toxicologist and a herbalist, combining science and nature to create plant-based skincare products. They are deeply committed to ethical practices, offering carbon-neutral, plastic-negative solutions and partnering with 1% For The Planet® to ensure their business contributes to positive environmental impact. </p>



<p><strong>Their goal was clear:</strong> to scale their business while maintaining sustainability and natural, practical skincare commitment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Starting Point</h2>



<p>When we first connected with the client, they were looking to increase their online transaction volume significantly. The initial target was to reach 500 monthly transactions, but their current campaigns were not driving the desired results. They required a <strong>growth marketing approach</strong> to enhance their reach and optimize ad spending. Additionally, they wanted to fine-tune their strategy for both B2B and B2C segments, ensuring <strong>the right audience was targeted for maximum impact.</strong></p>

<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Growth Method</h2>



<p>Our approach was a mix of technical precision and strategic testing. We began by thoroughly auditing their tracking tools, including Facebook Pixel and Conversions API, ensuring all data was accurately captured. From there, we developed a multi-layered strategy that touched every part of the customer funnel (TOFU, MOFU, BOFU).</p>



<p><strong>Technical Audit:</strong> We identified critical issues in their tracking and resolved them to ensure more accurate data reporting for both Meta and Google Ads.</p>



<p><strong>Campaign Audit:</strong> We reviewed their past ad campaigns, identifying what worked and what didn’t, which helped shape our new approach.</p>



<p><strong>Funnel Strategy:</strong> Our marketing strategy addressed each stage of the funnel — awareness, consideration, and conversion — tailoring our campaigns to fit the specific needs of each audience segment.</p>



<p><strong>Optimizing Meta Shop:</strong> We optimized their Meta Shop, enhancing product discoverability and making the shopping experience smoother for their customers.</p>



<p><strong>Audience Testing:</strong> Through Advantage+ Shopping and Catalog campaigns, we tested various audience interests and segments, eventually honing in on four key groups that delivered the best results.</p>



<p>Our early focus on dynamic retargeting campaigns delivered <strong>initial solid outcomes.</strong> From there, we shifted our focus toward segmenting B2B and B2C audiences, experimenting with different creative formats and strategies that resonated best with each group. We refined our ad content and creatives, launching standard and catalog retargeting campaigns that increased engagement and conversions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Success in Numbers</h2>



<p>The results of our strategy have been impressive, surpassing initial goals:</p>



<p><strong>Transaction Growth:</strong> We boosted the number of transactions from 332 to 850, driving revenue from $27,752.72 to $60,991.11.</p>



<p><strong>Revenue Increase:</strong> With a 155% increase in transactions, we achieved substantial revenue growth, making the campaigns practically profitable.</p>
