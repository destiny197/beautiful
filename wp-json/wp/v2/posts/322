Some sit quietly in your architecture, unlinked, uncrawled, and underperforming. These are called orphan pages, and if you care about SEO performance, you need to find and fix them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Orphan pages SEO issues are more common than most businesses think. Whether they result from poor internal linking, forgotten landing pages, or leftover content from redesigns, the damage they do can silently drain your crawl budget and weaken your site authority.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we will explain what orphan pages are, how to find orphan pages using practical tools, and how they negatively impact your internal linking strategy and crawlability.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"ez-toc-container\" class=\"ez-toc-v2_0_68_1 counter-hierarchy ez-toc-counter ez-toc-white ez-toc-container-direction\">\n<div class=\"ez-toc-title-container\">\n<span class=\"ez-toc-title-toggle\"><\/span><\/div>\n<nav><ul class='ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 ' ><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1\" href=\"https:\/\/um.marketing\/blog\/orphan-pages-what-they-are-how-to-find-them-and-why-they-hurt-seo\/#What_Are_Orphan_Pages\" title=\"What Are Orphan Pages?\">What Are Orphan Pages?<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2\" href=\"https:\/\/um.marketing\/blog\/orphan-pages-what-they-are-how-to-find-them-and-why-they-hurt-seo\/#Why_Orphan_Pages_Hurt_SEO\" title=\"Why Orphan Pages Hurt SEO\">Why Orphan Pages Hurt SEO<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3\" href=\"https:\/\/um.marketing\/blog\/orphan-pages-what-they-are-how-to-find-them-and-why-they-hurt-seo\/#How_to_Find_Orphan_Pages\" title=\"How to Find Orphan Pages\">How to Find Orphan Pages<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4\" href=\"https:\/\/um.marketing\/blog\/orphan-pages-what-they-are-how-to-find-them-and-why-they-hurt-seo\/#Best_Practices_to_Prevent_Orphan_Pages\" title=\"Best Practices to Prevent Orphan Pages\">Best Practices to Prevent Orphan Pages<\/a><\/li><li class='ez-toc-page-1 ez-toc-heading-level-2'><a class=\"ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5\" href=\"https:\/\/um.marketing\/blog\/orphan-pages-what-they-are-how-to-find-them-and-why-they-hurt-seo\/#Conclusion\" title=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion<\/a><\/li><\/ul><\/nav><\/div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"What_Are_Orphan_Pages\"><\/span>What Are Orphan Pages?<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Orphan pages are any pages on your website that are not linked from any other internal page. This means users and search engine bots cannot reach them by navigating your site\u2019s structure. The only way they get discovered is if they are submitted through a sitemap or externally linked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While technically live, they are disconnected from your internal linking strategy and often become invisible to Google.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Common causes of orphan pages:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Manual URL-only landing pages used in paid ads<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Content migrated during a site redesign but not re-linked<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Category pages no longer linked from main navigation<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Product pages that were delisted but still live<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Why_Orphan_Pages_Hurt_SEO\"><\/span>Why Orphan Pages Hurt SEO<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if the page is published, orphan pages fail to perform for several reasons:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">They waste crawl budget<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Google allocates a limited number of crawl attempts for your site. If orphan pages are in your sitemap but not linked internally, Google may crawl them repeatedly without context. This slows down indexing of more important pages and creates crawl noise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">They reduce topical authority<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Your internal linking strategy helps distribute authority across your site. If valuable content is isolated, it does not benefit from internal link equity. Worse, it cannot support other pages either.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">They fail to rank<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Without internal links, a page is unlikely to rank. Google considers internal linking a strong signal of a page\u2019s importance and relevance. Orphan pages get none of that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>They confuse sea<\/strong>r<strong>ch engines<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlinked content sends mixed signals. Google may not understand how the page fits into your site\u2019s hierarchy, which can prevent it from appearing in search features like snippets or sitelinks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"How_to_Find_Orphan_Pages\"><\/span>How to Find Orphan Pages<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You cannot fix what you cannot find. Here are reliable methods to detect orphan pages SEO issues across your site:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Compare your sitemap to your crawl<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Use tools like Screaming Frog or Sitebulb to crawl your site and export all discovered URLs. Then compare that list to your XML sitemap.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pages in sitemap but not crawled? Possible orphan.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pages crawled but not in sitemap or not linked? Investigate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Use Google Analytics and Search Console<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Identify landing pages that receive traffic but are not linked anywhere internally. These can include blog posts, abandoned service pages, or outdated offers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Check server logs<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Log analysis reveals what Googlebot is accessing. If certain URLs are only accessed via direct entry or sitemap, and not through internal paths, they are likely orphaned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Crawl with backlink tools<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahrefs and Semrush can also reveal orphan pages by highlighting URLs with zero internal links but existing external backlinks or traffic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fixing Orphan Pages the Right Way<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you locate orphan pages, decide whether to fix, merge, or remove them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Option 1: Reintegrate into your internal linking strategy<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Link from relevant blog posts or hub pages<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add them to the main navigation or sidebar<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use breadcrumbs to connect them to parent categories<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: Merge or redirect low-value pages<\/strong> If the content is outdated or duplicated, consolidate it with a stronger page and use a 301 redirect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3: Deindex or remove entirely<\/strong> For pages with no value, no traffic, and no links, consider removing them from your sitemap and adding a noindex directive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Best_Practices_to_Prevent_Orphan_Pages\"><\/span>Best Practices to Prevent Orphan Pages<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Use automated internal link checkers regularly<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create internal links from every new page to at least one existing one<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Include content audits in your SEO strategy every quarter<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maintain a clean and updated XML sitemap<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ensure all high-value pages are included in your site architecture<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span class=\"ez-toc-section\" id=\"Conclusion\"><\/span>Conclusion<span class=\"ez-toc-section-end\"><\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Orphan pages are a silent SEO killer. They waste crawl budget, weaken your internal linking strategy, and leave valuable content isolated and underutilized. As Google continues to prioritize topical authority and structured site architecture, these issues will only become more critical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding and fixing orphan pages is not just a cleanup task\u2014it is a strategic opportunity. You can recover traffic, improve crawl efficiency, and reinforce your content ecosystem by simply reconnecting what was once forgotten.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start your audit today. Find the gaps.
